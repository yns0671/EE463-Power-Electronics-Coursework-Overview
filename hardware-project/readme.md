# Hardware Project – DC Motor Drive System  
EE463 Power Electronics I

This folder contains the final hardware project of **EE463 – Power Electronics I**, focused on the complete design, simulation, and experimental validation of a **DC motor drive system** supplied from the AC grid.

## Project Summary

- Design of a high-power **DC motor drive** for a 5.5 HP separately excited DC machine  
- AC–DC–DC power conversion with controllable output voltage (0–180 V DC)  
- Emphasis on topology selection, component sizing, thermal design, and hardware reliability
